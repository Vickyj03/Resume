    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <img src="./rocketgirl.png" height="200" alt="a picture of a girl riding a rocket">
    <p>I have many creative interests, a small sample of which can be viewed below</p>
    <h3>Animation</h3>
    <p>I have always been interested in the magic of animation, ever since I was a little girl.
        This has continued into my adult life and I am currently working towards a postrgraduate degree in 3D character animation.
        But it is the beauty of traditional 2D animation that has always captivated me and it is my dream to someday have the means
        to produce my own short animated masterpiece.
    </p>
    <h3>Comic book art</h3>
    <p>In addition to animation, comics and manga have been a fascination for me ever since I was introduced to 2000AD
        as a child.  My absolute favourite comic book artists that have continued to inspire me to create the best art I can are
        Elf Quest's Wendy Pini and the truly talented Adam Warren.</p>
    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <p>When I was a stay at home mother with my second child, I took up creative writing and hired myself out briefly as a ghost writer of
        fiction.  Although I thoroughly enjoyed the work, I wanted to create my own ideas under my own name and so now, I enjoy writing as a hobby.
